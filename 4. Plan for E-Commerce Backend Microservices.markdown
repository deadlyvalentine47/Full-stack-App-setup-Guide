# Plan for E-Commerce Backend Microservices

## Overview
We’ll design a microservices architecture for our e-commerce application using Java Spring Boot. Each microservice will handle a specific domain (e.g., users, products, orders) to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability. We’ll integrate PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Kafka, Spring Security, and OAuth2, with APIs for all HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) per function. Spring Boot Actuator will monitor health, and JUnit will test each service.

## Microservices Breakdown
1. **User Service**
   - **Purpose**: Manages user authentication, registration, and profiles.
   - **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured user data.
   - **Security**: Spring Security + OAuth2 for secure login and authorization.
   - **APIs**:
     - POST /api/users - Register a user
     - GET /api/users/{id} - Get user details
     - PUT /api/users/{id} - Update user profile
     - DELETE /api/users/{id} - Delete user
   - **Features**: Store user sessions in Redis for fast access.

2. **Product Service**
   - **Purpose**: Handles product creation, retrieval, and management.
   - **Database**: MongoDB for flexible product data (e.g., varying attributes, descriptions).
   - **Caching**: Redis to cache frequently accessed product listings.
   - **APIs**:
     - POST /api/products - Create a product
     - GET /api/products/{id} - Get product details
     - GET /api/products - List all products
     - PUT /api/products/{id} - Update product
     - DELETE /api/products/{id} - Delete product
   - **Features**: Cache product lists for performance.

3. **Cart Service**
   - **Purpose**: Manages user shopping carts.
   - **Database**: Redis for fast, temporary cart storage.
   - **APIs**:
     - POST /api/cart - Add item to cart
     - GET /api/cart - View cart contents
     - PUT /api/cart/{itemId} - Update item quantity
     - DELETE /api/cart/{itemId} - Remove item
   - **Features**: Quick reads/writes via Redis; publish cart updates to Kafka.

4. **Order Service**
   - **Purpose**: Processes and tracks orders.
   - **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured order data.
   - **Messaging**: Kafka to publish order events (e.g., “order created”).
   - **APIs**:
     - POST /api/orders - Create an order
     - GET /api/orders/{id} - Get order details
     - GET /api/orders - List user orders
     - PUT /api/orders/{id} - Update order status
     - DELETE /api/orders/{id} - Cancel order
   - **Features**: Async order processing via Kafka.

5. **Payment Service**
   - **Purpose**: Handles payment initiation, status, and refunds.
   - **Database**: PostgreSQL for transaction records.
   - **Messaging**: Kafka for payment event notifications.
   - **APIs**:
     - POST /api/payments - Initiate payment
     - GET /api/payments/{id} - Check payment status
     - PUT /api/payments/{id} - Update payment details
     - DELETE /api/payments/{id} - Refund payment
   - **Features**: Secure transactions; async updates via Kafka.

## Technical Plan
### General Setup
- **Framework**: Spring Boot for each microservice.
- **Communication**: RESTful APIs between services; Kafka for event-driven async communication.
- **Security**: Spring Security + OAuth2 to protect all endpoints; JWT for inter-service auth.
- **Monitoring**: Spring Boot Actuator for health checks, metrics (e.g., /actuator/health, /actuator/metrics).
- **Testing**: JUnit for unit and integration tests per service.

### Architecture
- **Service Discovery**: Use Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka for service registration and discovery.
- **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway to route requests, handle CORS, and centralize auth.
- **Databases**:
  - PostgreSQL: User, Order, and Payment services (structured data).
  - MongoDB: Product service (flexible schema).
  - Redis: Cart service (fast key-value store) and caching for products, sessions.
- **Messaging**: Kafka for event-driven updates (e.g., order placed → notify payment service).
- **Configuration**: Spring Cloud Config for centralized, dynamic configuration.

### Development Phases
1. **Setup**
   - Initialize Spring Boot projects for each microservice.
   - Configure PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Kafka.
   - Set up Eureka for service discovery and Spring Cloud Gateway.
   - Integrate Spring Security + OAuth2 for authentication.
2. **Core Development**
   - Build and test APIs for each service (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).
   - Implement Redis caching for products and sessions.
   - Set up Kafka producers/consumers for order and payment events.
3. **Integration**
   - Ensure services communicate via REST and Kafka.
   - Secure all endpoints with OAuth2 and JWT.
   - Route requests through API Gateway.
4. **Testing**
   - Write JUnit tests for controllers, services, and repositories.
   - Test inter-service communication and error handling.
5. **Monitoring**
   - Enable Spring Boot Actuator endpoints for each service.
   - Monitor health, uptime, and performance metrics.
6. **Deployment**
   - Deploy services to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
   - Use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.

## Best Practices
- **Modularity**: Keep each microservice focused on one domain.
- **Scalability**: Use Redis for caching, Kafka for async processing.
- **Security**: Enforce OAuth2 and Spring Security; validate all inputs.
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses (e.g., 400, 404, 500) across services.
- **Logging**: Use SLF4J with Logback for centralized logging.
- **Performance**: Optimize database queries; cache where possible.

## Assumptions
- Each microservice runs independently, deployed on separate ports or containers.
- A third-party payment provider (e.g., Stripe) integrates via API.
- Initial focus is on core functionality; features like reviews or discounts can be added later.

## Next Steps
- Start with User Service: Set up OAuth2, Spring Security, and PostgreSQL.
- Proceed to Product Service, then Cart, Order, and Payment.
- Integrate services, test thoroughly, and monitor with Actuator.
